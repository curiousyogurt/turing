# Introduction

`turing` is a domain-specific language modelled on the language Alan Turing uses in his classic 1936 paper where he introduces Turing Machines.[*] There are many Turing Machine implementations available, but none model the language that Turing uses very closely. This implementation for Racket tries to get very close.

This repository is the source for the [turing package for Racket](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/turing).

# Installation

There are two easy ways to install the package.  The first way is to use the `raco` package manager:

    raco pkg install package-name

The other way is to use DrRacket:

    Open the "File" menu and select "Install Package…". In the field labelled "Package Source" enter "turing" (small "t") and click Install.

# Documentation

Complete documentation, including examples, is available at [racket-lang.org](https://docs.racket-lang.org/turing/index.html).
